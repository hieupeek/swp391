  77CHAPTER 5
Establishing the business 
requirements
Karen is a business analyst on a project to implement a new online product catalog for the company’s 
customer service representatives. The drafted SRS is going through review when the marketing  mana ger 
says he wants to add a “Like this product” feature. Karen’s first instinct is to push back; there is already 
concern about meeting schedules with the current requirements set. But then she realizes that maybe 
that’s a smart feature to add, because customer service representatives can promote the most-liked 
products with other customers. Before she elicits and documents functional requirements for this 
 feature, she needs an objective analysis about whether this feature should be added to the scope or not.
When she explains to the marketing manager the need to analyze this request further, he responds, 
“Well, soon the developers are going to be in there changing code anyway. How hard is it to add just 
one tiny feature?” Karen’s analysis determines that the proposed feature lies outside the project’s scope: 
it won’t contribute to the business objectives to reduce the customer service representatives’ average call 
time, and it wouldn’t be simple to implement. Karen needs to be able to clearly articulate why the feature 
isn’t in scope to the marketing manager, who doesn’t have the business objectives readily in mind.
As you saw in &hapter 1, “The essential software requirement,µ business requirements represent the 
top of the requirements chain. They deÀne the vision of the solution and the scope of the proMect that 
will implement the solution. The user requirements and functional requirements must align with the 
context and obMectives that the business requirements establish. Requirements that don’t help the 
proMect achieve its business obMectives shouldn’t be implemented.
A proMect without a clearly deÀned and well-communicated direction invites disaster. ProMect 
 participants can unwittingly work at cross-purposes if they have different obMectives and priorities. 
The stakeholders will never agree on the requirements if they lack a common understanding of the 
proMect’s business obMectives. Without this understanding up front, proMect deadlines will likely be 
missed and budgets will likely be overrun as the team struggles to deliver the right product.
This chapter describes the vision and scope document, a deliverable that contains the proMect’s 
business requirements. )igure 5-3 later in this chapter suggests a template for the vision and scope 
document. But before we get to the template, let’s see Must what we mean by “business requirements.µ
78 PART II Requirements developmentDefining business requirements
“Business requirementsµ refers to a set of information that, in the aggregate, describes a need that 
leads to one or more proMects to deliver a solution and the desired ultimate business outcomes. 
 Business opportunities, business obMectives, success metrics, and a vision statement make up the 
 business requirements.
Business requirements issues must be resolved before the functional and nonfunctional 
 requirements can be fully speciÀed. A statement of the proMect’s scope and limitations helps greatly 
with discussions of proposed features and target releases. The business requirements provide a 
 reference for making decisions about proposed requirement changes and enhancements. We 
 recommend displaying the business obMectives, vision, and scope highlights in every requirements 
 elicitation session so the team can quickly Mudge whether a proposed requirement is in or out of scope.
Identifying desired business benefits
The business requirements set the context for, and enable the measurement of, the beneÀts the 
business hopes to achieve from undertaking a proMect. 2rgani]ations should not initiate any proMect 
without a clear understanding of the value it will add to the business. Set measurable targets with 
business obMectives, and then deÀne success metrics that allow you to measure whether you are on 
track to meet those obMectives.
Business requirements might come from funding sponsors, corporate executives, marketing 
 managers, or product visionaries. +owever, it can be challenging to identify and communicate the 
business beneÀts. Team members sometimes aren’t exactly sure what the proMect is intended to 
 accomplish. Sometimes, sponsors don’t want to set obMectives in a measurable fashion and then be 
held accountable for achieving them. There could be multiple important stakeholders who don’t 
agree on what the obMectives should be. The business analyst can ensure that the right stakeholders 
are setting the business requirements and facilitate elicitation, prioriti]ation, and conÁict resolution. 
Karl Wiegers 2006  sugg ests some questions that the BA can ask to help elicit business requirements.
The business beneÀt has to represent a true value for the proMect’s sponsors and to the product’s 
customers. )or example, simply merging two systems into one is not a reasonable business obMective. 
&ustomers don’t care if they are using an application that involves 1, 5, or even 10 systems. They care 
about issues like increasing revenue and decreasing costs. Merging two systems might be part of the 
solution, but it is rarely the true business obMective. Regulatory and legal compliance proMects also 
have clear business obMectives. 2ften the obMectives are phrased as risk avoidance, possibly to avoid 
getting sued or being put out of business.
Product vision and project scope
Two core elements of the business requirements are the vision and the scope. The product vision  
succinctly describes the ultimate product that will achieve the business obMectives. This product could 
serve as the complete solution for the business requirements or as Must a portion of the solution. 
The vision describes what the product is about and what it ultimately could become. It provides the 
 CHAPTER 5  (stablishing the business requirements  79context for making decisions throughout the product’s life, and it aligns all stakeholders in a common 
direction. The project scope  identiÀes what portion of the ultimate product vision the current proMect 
or development iteration will address. The statement of scope draws the boundary between what’s in 
and what’s out for this proMect.
Important  The product vision ensures that we all know where we are hoping to go 
 eventually. The proMect scope ensures that we are all talking about the same thing for the 
immediate proMect or iteration.
Make sure the vision solves the problem
In one of our training courses, we give students a business problem and a corresponding 
 business obMective. Throughout the exercise, we periodically provide additional details about 
the requirements. At each step, we ask the students to conceive a solution to the problem, 
given the information they have. By the end of the exercise, all of the students’ solution ideas 
are similar, but rarely do any of them actually solve the original problem!
This mimics what we see on real proMects. Teams might set clear obMectives and then specify, 
develop, and test the system, without checking against the obMectives along the way.  
A stakeholder might come up with a “shinyµ new feature she wants implemented. The team 
adds it because it seems reasonable and interesting. +owever, months down the road, the 
 delivered system doesn’t solve the original problem, despite all of its cool features.
The vision applies to the product as a whole. The vision should change relatively slowly as a 
 product’s strategic positioning or a company’s business obMectives evolve over time. The scope 
 pertains to a speciÀc proMect or iteration that will implement the next increment of the product’s 
 functionality, as shown in )igure 5-1. Scope is more dynamic than vision because the  stakeholders 
 adMust the contents of each release within its schedule, budget, resource, and quality constraints. 
Scope for the current release should be clear, but the scope of future releases will be fu]]ier 
the  farther out you look. The team’s goal is to manage the scope of a speciÀc development or 
 enhancement proMect as a deÀned subset of the strategic vision for the product.
FIGURE 5-1  The product vision encompasses the scope for each planned release, which is less well deÀned the 
farther out you look.

80 PART II Requirements development 
Interlocking scopes
A federal government agency is undertaking a massive Àve-year information system 
 development effort. The agency deÀned the business obMectives and vision for this system early 
in the process; they won’t change substantially over the next few years. The agency has planned 
15 releases of portions of the ultimate system, each created by a separate proMect team and 
having its own scope description. Some proMects will run in parallel, because certain of them are 
relatively independent of each other and some have  longer timelines than others. (ach scope 
description must align with the overall product vision and interlock with the scope for the other 
proMects to ensure that nothing is inadvertently  omit ted and that lines of responsibility are clear.
Conflicting business requirements
Business requirements collected from multiple sources might conÁict. &onsider a kiosk that will be 
used by a retail store’s customers. )igure 5-2 shows the likely business interests of the kiosk developer, 
retailer, and customer as we envision how each of these stakeholders hopes the kiosk will provide an 
advantage over their current way of doing business.
FIGURE 5-2  Stakeholders for a kiosk don’t always have congruent business interests.
The various stakeholders’ obMectives sometimes are in alignment. )or instance, both the kiosk 
developers and the customers want to have a wide variety of products or services available through 
the kiosk. +owever, some business obMectives could conÁict. The customer wants to spend less time 
purchasing goods and services, but the retailer would prefer to have customers linger in the store and 

 CHAPTER 5  Establishing the business requirements  81spend more money. The tension among stakeholders with different goals and  constraints can lead to 
clashing business requirements. The proMect’s decision makers must resolve these conÁicts before the 
analyst can detail the kiosk’s requirements. The focus should be on delivering the maximum business 
value to the primary stakeholders. It’s easy to be distracted by superÀcial product characteristics that 
don’t really address the business objectives.
The proMect’s decision makers shouldn’t expect the software team to resolve conÁicts among 
various stakeholders. As more constituencies with diverse interests climb aboard, scope will grow. 
 Uncontrolled scope creep, in which stakeholders overstuff the new system in an attempt to satisfy 
every interest, can cause the project to topple under its own weight. A BA can help by surfacing 
potential areas of conÁict and differing assumptions, Áagging conÁicting business obMectives, noting 
when requested features don’t achieve those obMectives, and facilitating conÁict resolution. Resolving 
such issues is often a political and power struggle, which lies outside the scope of this book.
Long-duration projects often experience a change in decision makers partway through. If this 
 happens to you, immediately revisit the baselined business requirements with the new  decision 
 makers. They need to be aware of the existing business requirements, which they might want to 
modify. If so, the project manager will have to adjust budgets, schedules, and resources, while the 
BA might need to work with stakeholders to update user and functional requirements and reset their 
priorities.
Vision and scope document
The vision and scope document  collects the business requirements into a single deliverable that 
sets the stage for the subsequent development work. Some organizations create a project  charter 
 (Wiegers 2007) or a business case document that serves a similar purpose. Organizations that build 
commercial software often create a market or marketing requirements document MRD. An 
MRD might go into more detail about the target market segments and the issues that pertain to 
 commercial success.
The owner of the vision and scope document is the project’s executive sponsor, funding authority, 
or someone in a similar role. A business analyst can work with this individual to articulate the business 
requirements and write the vision and scope document. Input to the business requirements should 
come from people who have a clear sense of why they are undertaking the project. These individuals 
might include the customer or development organization’s senior management, a product visionary, a 
product manager, a subject matter expert, or members of the marketing department.
Figure 5-3 suggests a template for a vision and scope document; the sections that follow describe 
each of the template headings in more detail. As with any template, adapt this to meet the speciÀc 
needs of your own projects. If you already have recorded some of this information elsewhere, do not 
duplicate it in the vision and scope document. Some elements of the vision and scope document might 
be reusable from proMect to proMect, such as business obMectives, business risks, and stakeholder proÀles. 
Appendix C includes an example vision and scope document written according to this template.
82 PART II Requirements development
 
FIGURE 5-3  Suggested template for a vision and scope document.
The vision and scope document only deÀnes the scope at a high level; the scope details are 
represented by each release baseline that the team deÀnes. MaMor new proMects should have both a 
complete vision and scope document and an SRS. See &hapter 10, “Documenting the requirements,µ 
for an SRS template. (ach iteration, release, or enhancement proMect for an evolving product can 
include its own scope statement in that proMect’s requirements documentation, rather than creating a 
separate vision and scope document.
Template tactics
Templates provide a consistent way to organi]e information from one proMect to the next. They 
help me remember information that I might overlook if I started with a blank piece of paper.
I don’t Àll out a template from top to bottom. Instead, I populate the various sections as I 
accumulate information during the course of the proMect. (mpty sections highlight gaps in our 
current knowledge. Suppose one section of my document template is titled “Business risks.µ 
Partway through the proMect, I reali]e this section is empty. Does the proMect really have no 
business risks? +ave we identiÀed some business risks but stored them someplace else? 2r have 
we not yet worked with appropriate stakeholders to identify possible risks? Blank sections in 
the template help me conduct a richer exploration for important proMect information. If there 
are common questions you ask to elicit content for a section, consider embedding those in the 
 appropriate section of the template, perhaps in the form of hidden text, for others to reuse.
I use the term “shrink to Àtµ when working with templates. I begin with a rich template with 
many categories that might be important. Then I condense it down to Must what I need for each 
situation. Suppose that a certain section of the template³business risks, say³doesn’t  pertain 
to the current proMect. I can remove that section from my document or I can retain the  headin g 
but leave the contents blank. Both options run the risk that a reader will notice the hole and  
 
 CHAPTER 5  (stablishing the business requirements  83question whether there are indeed any business risks. The best solution is to put an explicit 
message in that section: “1o business risks have been  ident iÀed.µ
If certain sections of a template rarely get used, delete them. You might want to create a 
small set of templates for use on different types of proMects, such as SRS templates suitable for 
use on large, new development proMects; small websites; and enhancement proMects. (ven if you 
store your requirements in some repository other than a traditional document, a template can 
help you consider all the requirements information you need to accumulate for your proMect.
2ne proMect manager described the beneÀts his team received from adopting requirements 
document templates: “They are time consuming to Àll in. The Àrst couple of times I created 
them, I was surprised at the amount of detail required to make them useful, and then the 
amount of work taken to review and tidy up the documents, cleaning up any ambiguities, Àlling 
in gaps, etc. But it’s worth it. The Àrst two products that were developed after introducing the 
documents came in on time and were of much higher quality than before.µ
1. Business requirements
ProMects are launched in the belief that creating or changing a product will provide worthwhile 
 beneÀts for someone and a suitable return on investment. The business requirements describe 
the primary beneÀts that the new system will provide to its sponsors, buyers, and users. Business 
 requirements directly inÁuence which user requirements to implement and in what sequence.
1.1 Background
Summari]e the rationale and context for the new product or for changes to be made to an existing 
one. Describe the history or situation that led to the decision to build this product.
1.2 Business opportunity
)or a corporate information system, describe the business problem that is being solved or the  process 
being improved, as well as the environment in which the system will be used. )or a  comme rcial 
product, describe the business opportunity that exists and the market in which the product will be 
competing. This section could include a comparative evaluation of existing products, indicating 
why the proposed product is attractive and the advantages it provides. Describe the problems that 
cannot currently be solved without the envisioned solution. Show how it aligns with market trends, 
 technology evolution, or corporate strategic directions. /ist any other technologies, processes, or 
resources required to provide a complete customer solution.
Describe the needs of typical customers or of the target market. Present customer problems that 
the new  product will address. Provide examples of how customers would use the product. DeÀne any 
known critical interface or quality requirements, but omit design or implementation speciÀcs.
84 PART II Requirements development1.3 Business objectives
Summari]e the important business beneÀts the product will provide in a quantitative and  meas urable 
way. Platitudes “become recogni]ed as a world-class whatever!µ and vaguely stated  impro vements 
“provide a more rewarding customer experienceµ are neither helpful nor veriÀable. Table 5-1 presents 
some simpliÀed examples of both Ànancial and nonÀnancial business obMectives Wiegers 200.

2rgani]ations generally undertake a proMect to solve a problem or exploit an opportunity. A 
business obMectives model shows a hierarchy of related business problems and measurable business 
obMectives Beatty and &hen 2012. The problems describe what is keeping the business from  meet ing 
their goals at present, whereas the obMectives deÀne ways to measure achievement of those goals. 
Problems and obMectives are intertwined: understanding one can reveal the other.
Given a set of business obMectives, ask, “What is keeping us from achieving the goal?µ to identify 
a more detailed business problem. 2r work backward by asking, “Why do we care about that goal?µ 
to better understand the top-level business problem or opportunity. Given a business problem, ask, 
“+ow will we assess whether the problem is solved?µ to identify the measurable obMective. The process 
is iterative, cycling through the hierarchy of problems and obMectives until you see a list of features 
emerge that would help solve the problems and meet the obMectives.
A conversation between a business analyst and an executive sponsor to identify business problems 
and obMectives might look similar to the one in )igure 5-. This illustration is for the &hemical Tracking 
System proMect at &ontoso Pharmaceuticals that was introduced in &hapter 2, “Requirements from the 
customer’s perspective.µ )rom the executive’s responses to these questions, the BA could construct a 
business obMectives model for the &hemical Tracking System, as shown in )igure 5-5.
 CHAPTER 5  (stablishing the business requirements  85
FIGURE 5-4  (xample of a conversation between a business analyst and an executive sponsor.
1.4 Success metrics
Specify the indicators that stakeholders will use to deÀne and measure success on this proMect 
 Wiegers 200. Identify the factors that have the greatest impact on achieving that success, including 
factors both within and outside the organi]ation’s control.
Business obMectives sometimes cannot be measured until well after a proMect is complete. In other 
cases, achieving the business obMectives might be dependent on proMects beyond your current one. 
+owever, it’s still important to evaluate the success of an individual proMect. Success metrics  indica te 
whether a proMect is on track to meet its business obMectives. The metrics can be tracked during 
 testing or shortly after product release. )or the &hemical Tracking System, one  succe ss metric might 
be the same as Business 2bMective 3 in )igure 5-5 to “Reduce time spent  orde ring chemicals to  
10 minutes on 80 percent of orders,µ because you can measure the  average order time during  testing 
or soon after release. Another success metric might relate to Business 2bMective 2 with a timeline 
that can be measured much earlier than a year after release, such as “Track 60 percent of commercial 
chemical containers and 50 percent of proprietary chemicals within  weeks.µ
86 PART II Requirements development
FIGURE 5-5  (xample business obMectives model for the &hemical Tracking System.
 
Important  &hoose your success metrics wisely. Make sure they measure what is important 
to your business, not Must what is easy to measure. A success metric to “Reduce product 
development costs by 20 percentµ is easy to measure. It might also be easy to achieve 
by laying off employees or investing less in innovation. +owever, these might not be the 
 intended outcomes of the obMectives.

 CHAPTER 5  (stablishing the business requirements  871.5 Vision statement
Write a concise vision statement that summari]es the long-term purpose and intent of the  prod uct. 
The vision statement should reÁect a balanced view that will satisfy the expectations of diverse 
 stakeholders. It can be somewhat idealistic but should be grounded in the realities of existing or 
anticipated markets, enterprise architectures, corporate strategic directions, and resource limitations. 
The following keyword template works well for crafting a product vision statement Moore 2002:
 �For >target customer@
 �Who  >statement of the need or opportunity@
 �The >product name@
 �Is >product category@
 �That  >maMor capabilities, key beneÀt, compelling reason to buy or use@
 �Unlike  >primary competitive alternative, current system, current business process@
 �Our product  >statement of primary differentiation and advantages of new product@
+ere’s a sample vision statement for the &hemical Tracking System, with the keywords in boldface:
For scientists who need to request containers of chemicals, the Chemical Tracking 
System is an information system that will provide a single point of access to the 
chemical stockroom and to vendors. The system will store the location of every 
chemical container within the company, the quantity of material remaining in it, and 
the complete history of each container’s locations and usage. This system will save 
the company 25 percent on chemical costs in the first year of use by allowing the 
company to fully exploit chemicals that are already available within the company, 
dispose of fewer partially used or expired containers, and use a standard chemical 
purchasing process. Unlike  the current manual ordering processes, our product  
will generate all reports required to comply with federal and state government 
regulations that require the reporting of chemical usage, storage, and disposal.
Crafting the product vision
I use the vision statement in my own consulting work. 2ne longtime client and I work together 
very well, but occasionally Bill asks me to undertake a new proMect that’s a little different. If we 
aren’t exactly sure what he wants me to do, I ask him to write a vision statement. Bill always 
grumbles a bit because he knows that this will force him to think carefully about exactly what 
outcome he is expecting. But Bill’s vision statement invariably gives me a clear idea of Must what 
we are trying to accomplish so we can work efÀciently together. It’s well worth the time it takes.

88 PART II Requirements developmentYou might have several key stakeholders write their vision statements separately, rather 
than doing it as a group exercise. &omparing their vision statements is a good way to spot 
 different understandings about the proMect’s obMectives. And it’s never too late to write a vision 
 statement. (ven if the proMect is under way, crafting a vision statement can help keep the rest of 
the proMect work on track and in focus. Though drafting a vision statement is quick, crafting the 
right vision statement and reaching agreement among the key stakeholders will take more time.
1.6 Business risks
Summari]e the maMor business risks associated with developing³or not developing³this product. 
Risk categories include marketplace competition, timing issues, user acceptance, implementation 
 issues, and possible negative impacts on the business. Business risks are not the same as proMect risks, 
which often include resource availability concerns and technology factors. (stimate the potential loss 
from each risk, the likelihood of it occurring, and any potential mitigation actions. See &hapter 32, 
“Software requirements and risk management,µ for more about this topic.
1.7 Business assumptions and dependencies
An assumption  is a statement that is believed to be true in the absence of proof or deÀnitive 
 knowledge. Business assumptions are speciÀcally related to the business requirements.  Incor rect 
 assumptions can potentially keep you from meeting your business obMectives. )or example, an 
 executive sponsor might set a business obMective that a new website will increase revenue by $100,000 
per month. To establish this revenue target, the sponsor made some assumptions, perhaps that the 
new site will attract 200 additional unique visitors per day and that each visitor will spend an average 
of $1. If the new site does not attract enough visitors with a high enough average sale per visitor, the 
proMect might not achieve its business obMective. If you learn that certain assumptions are wrong, you 
might have to change scope, adMust the schedule, or launch other proMects to achieve the obMectives.
Record any assumptions that the stakeholders made when conceiving the proMect and writing their 
vision and scope document. 2ften, one party’s assumptions are not shared by others. If you write 
them down and review them, you can avoid possible confusion and aggravation in the future.
Record any maMor dependencies the proMect has on external factors. (xamples are pending 
 industry standards or government regulations, deliverables from other proMects, third-party suppliers, 
or development partners. Some business assumptions and dependencies might turn into risks that 
the proMect manager must monitor regularly. Broken dependencies are a common source of proMect 
delays. 1ote the impact of an assumption not being true, or the impact of a broken dependency, to 
help stakeholders understand why it is critical.
2. Scope and limitations
When a chemist invents a new reaction that transforms one kind of chemical into another, he writes a 
paper that includes a “Scope and limitationsµ section, which describes what the reaction will and will 
not do. Similarly, a software proMect should deÀne its scope and limitations. You need to state both 
what the solution being developed is and what it is not .
 CHAPTER 5  (stablishing the business requirements  89Many proMects suffer from scope creep³rampant growth as more and more functionality gets 
stuffed into the product. The Àrst step to controlling scope creep is to deÀne the proMect’s scope. 
The scope describes the concept and range of the proposed solution. The  limita tions itemi]e certain 
 capabilities that the product will not include that some people might assume will be there. The scope 
and limitations help to establish realistic stakeholder expectations because  custo mers sometimes 
request features that are too expensive or that lie outside the intended proMect scope.
Scope can be represented in numerous ways see “Scope representation techniquesµ later in this 
chapter. At the highest level, scope is deÀned when the customer decides which business obMectives 
to target. At a lower level, scope is deÀned at the level of features, user stories, use cases, or events 
and responses to include. Scope ultimately is deÀned through the set of functional requirements 
planned for implementation in a speciÀc release or iteration. At each level, the scope must stay within 
the bounds of the level above it. )or example, in-scope user requirements must map to the business 
obMectives, and functional requirements must map to user requirements that are in scope.
Blue-sky requirements
A manager at a product development company that suffered near-catastrophic scope creep 
once told me ruefully, “We blue-skied the requirements too much.µ She meant that any idea 
anyone had was included in the requirements. This company had a solid product  vision, but 
they didn’t manage the scope by planning a series of releases and deferring some  suggested 
features to later perhaps inÀnitely later releases. The team Ànally released an  overinÁated 
product after four years of development. It can be valuable to Mot down the  blue-sky 
 requirements for future consideration. +owever, thoughtful scope management and an 
 incremental development approach would have let the team ship a useful product much earlier.
2.1 Major features
/ist the product’s maMor features or user capabilities, emphasi]ing those that distinguish it from 
previous or competing products. Think about how users will use the features, to ensure that the list is 
complete and that it does not include unnecessary features that sound interesting but don’t provide 
customer value. Give each feature a unique and persistent label to permit tracing it to other system 
 elements. You might include a feature tree diagram, as described later in this chapter.
2.2 Scope of initial release
Summari]e the capabilities that are planned for inclusion in the initial product release. Scope is often 
deÀned in terms of features, but you can also deÀne scope in terms of user stories, use cases, use case 
Áows, or external events. Also describe the quality characteristics that will let the  prod uct  provide 
the intended beneÀts to its various user classes. To focus the development effort and  mainta in 
a  reasonable proMect schedule, avoid the temptation to include every feature that any  potential 
 customer might eventually want in release 1.0. Bloatware and slipped schedules are common 
 outcomes of such insidious scope stufÀng. )ocus on those features that will provide the most value, at 
the most acceptable cost, to the broadest community, in the earliest time frame.

90 PART II Requirements developmentAs an illustration, a recent proMect team decided that users had to be able to run their  pack age 
delivery business with the Àrst release of the software application. Version 1 didn’t have to be fast, 
pretty, or easy to use, but it had to be reliable; this focus drove everything the team did. The  initial 
 release accomplished the basic obMectives of the system. )uture releases will include additional 
 features, options, and usability aids. Be careful not to neglect nonfunctional requirements in the initial 
release, though. The ones that directly affect architecture are particularly critical to establish from the 
outset. Rearchitecting to try to Àx quality deÀciencies can be almost as expensive as a total rewrite. 
See &hapter 1, “Beyond functionality,µ for more about software quality attributes.
2.3 Scope of subsequent releases
If you envision a staged evolution of the product, or if you are following an iterative or incremental 
life cycle, build a release roadmap that indicates which functionality chunks will be deferred and 
the desired timing of later releases. Subsequent releases let you implement additional use cases 
and features, as well as enriching the capabilities of the initial ones. The farther out you look, the 
fu]]ier these future scope statements will be and the more they will change over time. (xpect to shift 
 functionality from one planned release to another and to add unanticipated capabilities. Short release 
cycles provide frequent opportunities for learning based on customer feedback.
2.4 Limitations and exclusions
/ist any product capabilities or characteristics that a stakeholder might expect but that are not 
planned for inclusion in the product or in a speciÀc release. /ist items that were cut from scope, so the 
scope decision is not forgotten. Maybe a user requested that she be able to access the system from 
her phone while away from her desk, but this was deemed to be out of scope. State that explicitly in 
this section: “The new system will not provide mobile platform support.µ
3. Business context
This section presents proÀles of maMor stakeholder categories, management’s priorities for the proMect, 
and a summary of some factors to consider when planning deployment of the solution.
3.1 Stakeholder profiles
Stakeholders  are the people, groups, or organi]ations that are actively involved in a proMect, are 
 affected by its outcome, or are able to inÁuence its outcome Smith 2000; IIBA 2009; PMI 2013. 
The stakeholder proÀles describe different categories of customers and other key stakeholders 
for the proMect. You needn’t describe every stakeholder group, such as legal staff who must check 
for  compliance with pertinent laws on a website development proMect. )ocus on different types 
of  customers, target market segments, and the various user classes within those segments. (ach 
 stakeholder proÀle should include the following information:
 �The maMor value or beneÀt that the stakeholder will receive from the product. Stakeholder 
value could be deÀned in terms of:
 Improved productivity.

 CHAPTER 5  (stablishing the business requirements  91 Reduced rework and waste.
 &ost savings.
 Streamlined business processes.
 Automation of previously manual tasks.
 Ability to perform entirely new tasks.
 &ompliance with pertinent standards or regulations.
 Improved usability compared to current products.
 �Their likely attitudes toward the product.
 �MaMor features and characteristics of interest.
 �Any known constraints that must be accommodated.
You might include a list of key stakeholders by name for each proÀle or an organi]ation chart that 
shows the relationships among the stakeholders within the organi]ation.
3.2 Project priorities
To enable effective decision making, the stakeholders must agree on the proMect’s priorities. 2ne 
way to approach this is to consider the Àve dimensions of features, quality, schedule, cost, and staff 
 Wiegers 1996. (ach dimension Àts in one of the following three categories on any given proMect:
 �Constraint  A limiting factor within which the proMect manager must operate
 �Driver A signiÀcant success obMective with limited Áexibility for adMustment
 �Degree of freedom  A factor that the proMect manager has some latitude to adMust and 
 balance against the other dimensions
The proMect manager’s challenge is to adMust the degrees of freedom to achieve the proMect’s 
 success drivers within the limits imposed by the constraints. Suppose marketing suddenly demands 
that you release the product one month earlier than scheduled. +ow do you respond? Do you:
 �Defer certain requirements to a later release?
 �Shorten the planned system test cycle?
 �Demand overtime from your staff or hire contractors to accelerate development?
 �Shift resources from other proMects to help out?
The proMect priorities drive the actions you take when such eventualities arise. Realistically, when 
change happens, you need to have conversations with the key stakeholders to determine the most 
appropriate actions to take based on the change requested. )or example, marketing might want to 
add features or shorten a timeline, but perhaps they are willing to defer certain features in exchange. 
See Appendix & for an example of how to document these proMect priorities.
92 PART II Requirements development 
Important  1ot all of the Àve dimensions can be constraints, and they cannot all be drivers. 
The  proMect manager needs some degrees of freedom to be able to respond appropriately 
when  requirements or proMect realities change.
3.3 Deployment considerations
Summari]e the information and activities that are needed to ensure an effective deployment of the 
solution into its operating environment. Describe the access that users will require to use the system, 
such as whether the users are distributed over multiple time ]ones or located close to each other. 
State when the users in various locations need to access the system. If infrastructure changes are 
needed to support the software’s need for capacity, network access, data storage, or data migration, 
describe those changes. Record any information that will be needed by people who will be preparing 
training or modifying business processes in conMunction with deployment of the new solution.
Scope representation techniques
The models described in this section can be used to represent proMect scope in various ways. You 
don’t need to create all of these models; consider which ones provide the most useful insight for 
each proMect. The models can be included in the vision and scope document or stored elsewhere and 
referenced as needed.
The purpose of tools such as the context diagram, ecosystem map, feature tree, and event list 
is to foster clear and accurate communication among the proMect stakeholders. That clarity is more 
important than dogmatically adhering to the rules for a “correctµ diagram. We strongly recommend, 
though, that you adopt the notations illustrated in the following examples as standards for drawing 
the diagrams. )or example, in a context diagram, suppose you were to use a triangle to represent the 
system instead of a circle, and ovals rather than rectangles for external entities. Your colleagues would 
have difÀculty reading a diagram that follows your personal preferences rather than a team standard.
&ontext diagrams, ecosystem maps, feature trees, and event lists are the most common ways 
to represent scope visually. +owever, other techniques are also used. Identifying affected  busin ess 
 processes also can help deÀne the scope boundary. 8se case diagrams can depict the scope boundary 
between use cases and actors see &hapter 8,  “8nd erstanding user requirementsµ.
Context diagram
The scope description establishes the boundary and connections between the system you’re 
 developing and everything else in the universe. The context diagram  visually illustrates this boundary. 
It identiÀes external entities also called  terminators  outside the system that interface to it in some 
way, as well as data, control, and material flows between the terminators and the system. The context 
diagram is the top level in a data Áow diagram developed according to the principles of structured 
analysis Robertson and Robertson 199, but it’s a useful model for all proMects.

 CHAPTER 5  (stablishing the business requirements  93)igure 5-6 illustrates a portion of the context diagram for the &hemical Tracking System. The 
entire system is depicted as a single circle; the context diagram deliberately provides no visibility 
into the system’s internal obMects, processes, or data. The “systemµ inside the circle could  encom pass 
any combination of software, hardware, and human components. Therefore, it could include manual 
 operations as part of the entire system. The external entities in the rectangles can represent user 
classes &hemist, Buyer, organi]ations +ealth and Safety Department, other systems Training 
 Database, or hardware devices Bar &ode Reader. The arrows on the diagram represent the Áow of 
data such as a request for a chemical or physical items such as a chemical container between the 
system and its external entities.
You might expect to see chemical vendors shown as an external entity in this diagram. After all, 
the company will route orders to vendors for fulÀllment, the vendors will send chemical containers 
and invoices to &ontoso Pharmaceuticals, and &ontoso’s purchasing department will pay the vendors. 
+owever, those processes take place outside the scope of the &hemical Tracking System, as part of 
the operations of the purchasing and receiving departments. Their absence from the context diagram 
makes it clear that this system is not directly involved in placing orders with the vendors, receiving the 
products, or paying the bills.
FIGURE 5-6  Partial context diagram for the &hemical Tracking System.
94 PART II Requirements developmentEcosystem map
An ecosystem map  shows all of the systems related to the system of interest that interact with one 
another and the nature of those interactions Beatty and &hen 2012. An ecosystem map represents 
scope by showing all the systems that interconnect and that therefore might need to be  modiÀ ed 
to accommodate your new system. (cosystem maps differ from context diagrams in that they show 
 other systems that have a relationship with the system you’re working on, including those without 
 direct  interfaces. You can identify the affected systems by determining which ones consume data 
from your system. When you reach the point that your proMect does not affect any additional data, 
you’ve  identiÀed the scope boundary of systems that participate in the solution.
)igure 5- is a partial ecosystem map for the &hemical Tracking System. The systems are all shown 
in boxes such as the Purchasing System or Receiving System. In this example, the primary system 
we are working on is shown in a bold box &hemical Tracking System, but if all systems have equal 
status in your solution, you can use the same box style for all of them. The lines show interfaces 
between systems for instance, the Purchasing System interfaces to the &hemical Tracking System. 
/ines with arrows and labels show that maMor pieces of data are Áowing from one system to another 
for  instance, “training recordsµ are passed from the &orporate Training Database to the &hemical 
 Tracking System. Some of these same Áows can also appear on the context diagram.
FIGURE 5-7  Partial ecosystem map for the &hemical Tracking System.
The ecosystem map in )igure 5- shows that the &hemical Tracking System does not directly connect 
to the 2S+A(PA Reporting Interface. 1onetheless, you need to consider whether any requirements 
in the &hemical Tracking System arise because of the data that Áows from it, through the +ealth and 
Safety Incident Database, and to that reporting interface.
 CHAPTER 5  (stablishing the business requirements  95Feature tree
A feature tree  is a visual depiction of the product’s features organi]ed in logical groups,  hierarchically 
subdividing each feature into further levels of detail Beatty and &hen 2012. The feature tree 
 provides a concise view of all of the features planned for a proMect, making it an ideal model to show 
to executives who want a quick glance at the proMect scope. A feature tree can show up to three levels 
of features, commonly called level 1 /1, level 2 /2, and level 3 /3. /2 features are subfeatures of /1 
features, and /3 features are subfeatures of /2 features.
)igure 5-8 shows a partial feature tree for the &hemical Tracking System. The main branch of 
the tree in the middle represents the product being implemented. (ach feature has its own line or 
“branchµ coming off that central main branch. The gray boxes represent the /1 features, such as 2rder 
&hemicals and Inventory Management. The lines coming off an /1 branch are /2 features: Search 
and &hemical Request are subfeatures of 2rder &hemicals. The branches off an /2 branch are the /3 
features: /ocal /ab Search is a subfeature of Search.
FIGURE 5-8  Partial feature tree for the &hemical Tracking System.
When planning a release or an iteration, you can deÀne its scope by selecting a speciÀc set of 
features and subfeatures to be implemented 1eMmeh and Thomas 2002; Wiegers 2006. You could 
implement a feature in its entirety in a speciÀc release, or you could implement only a portion of 
it by choosing Must certain /2 and /3 subfeatures. )uture releases could enrich these rudimentary 
 implementations by adding more /2 and /3 subfeatures until each feature is fully implemented in the 
Ànal product. So the scope of a particular release consists of a deÀned set of /1, /2, andor /3 features 
chosen from the feature tree. You can mark up a feature tree diagram to illustrate these feature 
96 PART II Requirements development allocations across releases by using colors or font variations. Alternatively, you can create a feature 
roadmap table that lists the subfeatures planned for each release Wiegers 2006.
Event list
An event list  identiÀes external events that could trigger behavior in the system. The event list depicts the 
scope boundary for the system by naming possible business events triggered by users, time-triggered 
temporal events, or signal events received from external components, such as hardware devices. The 
event list only names the events; the functional requirements that describe how the system responds 
to the events would be detailed in the SRS by using event-response tables. See &hapter 12, “A picture is 
worth 102 words,µ for more information about event-response tables.
)igure 5-9 is a partial event list for the &hemical Tracking System. (ach item in the list states what 
triggers the event “&hemistµ does something or the “Time toµ do something arrives, as well as 
 identifying the event action. An event list is a useful scoping tool because you can allocate certain 
events to be implemented in speciÀc product releases or development iterations.
FIGURE 5-9  Partial event list for the &hemical Tracking System.
1otice how the event list complements the context diagram and ecosystem map. The context 
 diagram and ecosystem map collectively describe the external actors and systems involved, whereas 
the event list identiÀes what those actors and systems might do to trigger behavior in the system 
 being  speciÀed. You can check the event list against the context diagram and ecosystem map for 
 correctness and completeness, as follows:
 �&onsider whether each external entity on the context diagram is the source of any events:  
“Do any actions by &hemists trigger behavior in the &hemical Tracking System?µ
 �&onsider whether any systems in the ecosystem map lead to events for your system.
 �)or each event, consider whether you have corresponding external entities in the context 
diagram or systems in the ecosystem map: “If a chemical container can be received from a 
vendor, does Vendor appear in the context diagram andor ecosystem map?µ
If you Ànd a disconnect, consider whether the model is missing an element. In this case, Vendor did 
not appear on the context diagram because the &hemical Tracking System doesn’t interface directly 
to vendors. +owever, Vendor is included in the ecosystem map.
 CHAPTER 5  (stablishing the business requirements  97Keeping the scope in focus
A scope deÀnition is a structure, not a straitMacket. The business requirements and an understanding 
of how customers will use the product provide valuable tools for dealing with scope change. Scope 
change isn’t a bad thing if it helps you steer the proMect toward satisfying evolving customer needs. 
The information in the vision and scope document lets you assess whether proposed requirements 
are appropriate for inclusion in the proMect. You can modify the scope for a future iteration or for an 
entire proMect if it’s done consciously, by the right people, for the right business reasons, and with 
understanding and acceptance of the tradeoffs.
Remember, whenever someone requests a new requirement, the analyst needs to ask, “Is this in 
scope?µ 2ne response might be that the proposed requirement is clearly out of scope. Perhaps it’s 
interesting, but it should be addressed in a future release or by another proMect. Another possibility 
is that the request obviously lies within the deÀned proMect scope. You can incorporate new in-scope 
requirements in the current proMect if they are of high priority relative to the other requirements that 
were already committed. Including new requirements often involves making a decision to defer or 
cancel other planned requirements, unless you’re willing to extend the proMect’s duration.
The third possibility is that the proposed new requirement is out of scope, but it’s such a good 
idea that the scope should be broadened to accommodate it, with corresponding changes in 
 budget, schedule, andor staff. That is, there’s a feedback loop between the user requirements and 
the  business requirements. This will require that you update the vision and scope document, which 
should have been placed under change control at the time it was baselined. Keep a record of why 
 requirements were reMected; they have a way of reappearing. &hapter 2, “Requirements management 
practices,µ describes how to use a requirement attribute to track reMected or deferred requirements.
Using business objectives to make scoping decisions
The business obMectives are the most important factor to consider when making scope  decisions. 
 Determine which proposed features or user requirements add the most value with respect to 
the business obMectives; schedule those for the early releases. When a stakeholder wants to add 
 functionality, consider how the suggested changes will contribute to achieving the business 
 obMectives. )or example, a business obMective to generate maximum revenue from a kiosk implies the 
early implementation of features that sell more products or services to the customer. Glit]y features 
that appeal to only a few technology-hungry customers and don’t contribute to the primary business 
obMective shouldn’t have high priority.
If possible, quantify the contribution the feature makes towards the business obMectives, so that 
people can make scoping decisions on the basis of facts rather than emotions Beatty and &hen 
2012. Will a speciÀc feature contribute roughly $1,000, $100,000, or $1,000,000 toward a business 
 obMective? When an executive requests a new feature that he thought of over the weekend, you can 
use quantitative analysis to help determine if adding it is the right business decision.
98 PART II Requirements developmentAssessing the impact of scope changes
When the proMect’s scope increases, the proMect manager usually will have to renegotiate the 
planned budget, resources, schedule, andor staff. Ideally, the original schedule and resources will 
 accommodate a certain amount of change because of thoughtfully included contingency buffers 
Wiegers 200. 2therwise, you’ll need to re-plan after requirements changes are approved.
A common consequence of scope change is that completed activities must be reworked in 
 response to the changes. Quality often suffers if the allocated resources or time are not increased 
when new functionality is added. Documented business requirements make it easier to manage 
 legitimate scope growth as the marketplace or business needs change. They also help a harried 
 proMect manager to Mustify saying “noµ³or at least “not yetµ³when inÁuential people try to stuff 
more features into an overly constrained proMect.
Vision and scope on agile projects
Managing scope on an agile proMect, in which development is performed in a series of Àxed  timeb ox 
iterations, takes a different approach. The scope of each iteration consists of user stories selected 
from a dynamic product backlog, based on their relative priority and the estimated delivery 
 capacity of the team for each timebox. Instead of trying to Àght scope creep, the team prioriti]es 
new  requirements against existing items in the backlog and allocates them to future iterations. The 
 number of iterations³and hence the overall proMect duration³still depends on the total amount 
of functionality to be implemented, but the scope of each iteration is controlled to ensure timely 
completion. Alternatively, some agile proMects Àx the overall proMect duration, yet are willing to modify 
the scope. The number of iterations might remain the same, but the scope addressed in remaining 
iterations changes according to the relative priorities of existing and newly deÀned user stories.
The team can deÀne a high-level roadmap of iterations at the beginning of the proMect, but the user story 
allocation for an iteration will be performed at the beginning of each iteration. Referencing the business  
requirements as the team sets the scope for each iteration helps to ensure that the proMect delivers a 
product that meets the business obMectives. The same strategy can be used on any proMect that follows a 
timeboxed development process see the “Scope management and timeboxed developmentµ sidebar.
Scope management and timeboxed development
(nrique, a proMect manager at /itware, Inc., had to deliver a web-enabled version of /itware’s 
Áagship portfolio-management software. It would take about two years to fully supplant 
the  mature application, but /itware needed a web presence right away. (nrique selected a 
 timeboxed development approach, promising to release a new version every 90 days. +is 
marketing team carefully prioriti]ed the product’s requirements. The SRS for each quarterly 
release included a committed set of new and enhanced features, as well as a list of lower-priority 
“stretchµ requirements to be implemented as time permitted. (nrique’s team didn’t  incorp orate 
every stretch requirement into each release, but they did ship a stable release every three 
months through this schedule-driven approach to scope management. Schedule and quality are 
normally constraints on a timeboxed proMect, and scope is a degree of freedom.
 CHAPTER 5  (stablishing the business requirements  99Although agile proMects might not create a formal vision and scope document, the contents from 
the template in )igure 5-3 are both relevant and essential to delivering a successful product. Many 
agile proMects conduct an upfront planning iteration iteration ]ero to deÀne the overarching product 
vision and other business requirements for the proMect.
Business requirements need to be deÀned for all software proMects, regardless of their 
 development approach. The business obMectives describe the expected value coming out of the 
 proMect, and on an agile proMect, they are used to help prioriti]e the backlog to deliver the most 
 business value in the earliest iterations. Success metrics should be deÀned so that as iterative  releases 
go live, the success can be measured and the rest of the backlog adMusted accordingly. A vision 
 statement describes the long-term plan for what the product will be after all iterations are complete.
Using business objectives to determine completion
+ow do you know when you can stop implementing functionality? Traditionally, a proMect manager 
manages the proMect towards completion. +owever, a business analyst is intimately familiar with the 
business obMectives and can help determine when the desired value has been delivered, implying that 
the work is done.
If you begin with a clear vision for the solution, and if each release or iteration is scoped to deliver 
Must a portion of the total functionality, then you will be done when you complete the preplanned 
iterations. The completed iterations should have led to a fully reali]ed product vision that meets the 
business obMectives.
+owever, particularly in iterative development approaches, the end point might be vague. 
Within each iteration, scope is deÀned for that iteration. As the proMect continues, the backlog of 
 uncompleted work dwindles. It’s not always necessary to implement the entire set of remaining 
 functionality. It’s critical to have clear business obMectives so that you can move toward satisfying 
those obMectives incrementally as information becomes available. The proMect is complete when the 
success metrics indicate that you have a good chance of meeting the business obMectives. Vague 
 business obMectives will guarantee an open-ended proMect with no way to know when you’re done. 
)unding sponsors don’t like it because they don’t know how to budget, schedule, or plan for such 
proMects. &ustomers don’t like it because they might receive a  solution that is delivered on time and 
on budget but that doesn’t provide the value they need. But that might Must be the risk of working 
on products that cannot be clearly deÀned at the outset, unless you reÀne the business obMectives 
partway through the proMect.
)ocus on deÀning clear business requirements for all of your proMects. 2therwise, you are Must 
wandering about aimlessly hoping to accomplish something useful without any way to know if you’re 
reaching your destination.

 �Ask several stakeholders for your proMect each to write a vision statement using the 
 keyword template described in this chapter. See how similar the visions are. Rectify any 
disconnects and come up with a uniÀed vision statement that all those stakeholders  
agree to.
 �Whether you’re near the launch of a new proMect or in the midst of construction, 
 document the business requirements by using the template in )igure 5-3. 2r, simply 
create a business obMectives model, and have the rest of the team review it. This might 
reveal that your team doesn’t share a common understanding of the proMect’s obMectives 
or scope. &orrect that problem now; it will be even more difÀcult to correct if you wait. 
This activity will also suggest ways to modify the template to best meet the needs of your
